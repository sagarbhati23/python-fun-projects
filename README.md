# Python Fun Projects  

## Overview  
This repository contains two Python projects I created for fun. The projects showcase simple yet engaging ideas that involve encoding/decoding and a classic game simulation.  

# Projects
[Secret Code Language](secret_code_language.py)  
[Snake, Water, and Gun Game](snake_water_gun_game.py)

### 1. **Secret Code Language**  
**Description**:  
This project encodes or decodes a code-word language based on predefined rules. It can be used to create a secret conversation system that only you and your friend can understand.  

**Features**:  
- Encode messages into a secret language.  
- Decode secret messages back to their original form.  

**How to Run**:  
1. Clone the repository using the command:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-fun-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd python-fun-projects
   ```  
3. Run the Python file using the command:  
   ```
   python secret_code_language.py
   ```


### 2. **Snake, Water, and Gun Game**  
**Description**:  
This project is a Python implementation of the game "Snake, Water, and Gun," which is similar to "Stone, Paper, and Scissors." The player competes against the computer, and the result is determined based on the game's rules.  

**Features**:  
- Play against the computer.  
- Randomized outcomes for fairness.  
- Displays win, lose, or draw results.  

**How to Run**:  
1. Clone the repository using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-fun-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd python-fun-projects
   ```  
3. Run the Python file using the command:  
   ```bash
   python snake_water_gun_game.py
